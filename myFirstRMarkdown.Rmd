```

## R Markdown

This is my **first** R markdown document. This document is associated with the Coursera Data Scientist's Tookbox course week 4.  

```{r}
print("Hello World!")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
